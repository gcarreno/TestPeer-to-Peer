# Test Peer-to-Peer
This is an attempt at a very basic peer class that can participate on a Peer-to-Peer( `P2P` ) network.

It will not have peer discovery via `UDP` broadcast, nor will it have any `DHT` features.

Just a simple message exchange protocol in a `P2P` context.

## Disclaimer

In the spirit of full disclosure and due to my utter laziness in coming up with the bulk of the boilerplate code, I turned to `ChatGPT`.

You can see the series pf prompts and answers I've got in the [research](research) folder.
